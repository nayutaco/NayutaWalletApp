Greetings and apologies for not putting this in an Issue.

I work with walletScrutiny.com and we scrutinize Bitcoin apps and devices that claim or that are 
source-available or Open Source. 

We noticed that 

1. The 'Issues' tab is not available publicly
2. There are no build instructions for the Android app. 

It would be beneficial for the Open Source community and in line with best-practices if these
functionalities were available. 

Thank you.
